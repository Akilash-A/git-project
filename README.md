# Real-Time Network Packet Monitor

A Next.js application that provides real-time network packet monitoring capabilities similar to Wireshark, with a modern web interface for security analysis and threat detection.

## Features

### üîÑ Real-Time Monitoring
- Live packet capture from network interfaces
- WebSocket-based real-time data streaming
- Support for TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols
- Automatic packet parsing and analysis

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Analysis
- Real-time threat detection and alerting
- Attack pattern recognition (DDoS, Port Scans, Malware, etc.)
- IP whitelisting for trusted sources
- Security event logging and analysis

### üåê Network Interface Management
- Multiple network interface support
- Interface selection and configuration
- Real-time interface status monitoring
- Network adapter information display

### üîç Advanced Filtering
- IP address filtering
- Port-based filtering
- Protocol-specific monitoring
- Custom filter configurations

### üìä Dashboard & Analytics
- Real-time packet statistics
- Attack detection metrics
- Interactive packet table with detailed information
- Historical data visualization

## Quick Start

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install
npm run install:server

# Run both frontend and backend
npm run dev:full

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: ws://localhost:3001
```

### Usage
1. **Start Monitoring**: Launch both servers and navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. **Select Interface**: Choose your network interface from the dropdown
3. **Configure Filters**: Set up IP, port, or protocol filters as needed
4. **Begin Monitoring**: Click "Start Monitoring" for real-time packet capture

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js dashboard with real-time WebSocket connectivity
- **Backend**: Node.js packet capture service with Socket.IO
- **Real-time Data**: Live packet streaming and analysis
- **Security Features**: Threat detection and IP whitelisting

## Security Notice
‚ö†Ô∏è This tool requires network interface access and should only be used for authorized network monitoring. Ensure compliance with local regulations and privacy policies.
